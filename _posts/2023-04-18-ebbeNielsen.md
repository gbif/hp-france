GBIF announced its call for nominations for the **2023 GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge**, aiming to recognize innovations that leverage biodiversity data and tools from the GBIF network to advance open science. An expert jury will judge entries on their openness and repeatability, relevance and novelty and present a selected pool of winners with a total of up to *â‚¬20,000* in prizes.

Challenge entries can take any number of forms, as entrants may choose to develop new applications, visualizations, methods, workflows or analyses, often (but not always) making use of the [GBIF API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary) to access data. Entries may also build on or extend the capabilities of existing tools and features available across the GBIF network.

Between now and **22 August 2023**, individuals and teams can prepare tools and techniques that improve the access, usefulness and quality of open biodiversity data and submit them to this open-ended, annual incentive competition.
